# PacMen-Exercise
This project consist in having two buttons. One is to create a pacmen image and display it as many times you click on it and another one is to make the pacmen image move and bounce on every border.

How To Run:

  Download all repository files.
  Open the Pacmen.html.
  The page will show a blank website with two buttons. One is to create the Pacmen image and the other one is to make the images move. 
  Click on both buttons to see it in action.
  
  Roadmap of future improvements: 
  I thought to create other images and make them change based on the direction they are going.
